Update: Guess what? The stars aligned, the Apple gods smiled upon us, and on that fateful day, **May 7th, 2022, a real-deal MacBook Pro (16 inch, M1 Pro)** joined my gadget family! üçéüíª It's been a wild rollercoaster ride, switching gears from the world of hackintoshing to the glorious realm of Macintoshing!

I've waved goodbye to the quirky late-night kext dancing, the USB installation jig, and the relentless config.plist tweaking. But you know what? The memories, oh, the memories of those "joyful hackintoshing" moments will forever be etched in the annals of my journey.

Now, my trusty Hackintosh EFI repository is like a scrapbook of all those wild escapades ‚Äì a virtual time capsule reminding us of the hacks, the laughs, and the epic facepalms. ‚ú®

So here's to you, my Hackintoshing comrades! The ones who dared to dance on the edge, who embraced the chaos, and who turned lines of code into works of art. Our paths may have diverged, but the spirit of hackintoshing will forever echo in the chambers of this EFI repository.

Keep hacking, keep creating, and remember, the journey is just as important as the destination. üöÄüåå Stay curious, stay quirky, and keep chasing those Macintosh dreams!
